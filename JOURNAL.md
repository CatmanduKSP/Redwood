Started my project! Looked at inspiration on the highway gallery, my idea is to make a long-range Osprey-style tiltrotor drone that can transition between hovering and regular flight. Currently, I'm figuring out how the whole Hackclub thing works with the help of my cousin, Kashyap.
Sent a message in the slack to ask for advice on what frequency to use. I know I'm using RF, but some frequencies are banned in the U.S.
I found my first part! I really can't buy motors, design props and the chassis, or find a suitable battery until I have a general idea of how much the drone will weigh. I decided it was best to start with the video and control systems. This will also help with designing the aircraft, as I know where all of the antennas will have to be. My FPV camera willl be the RunCam Robin 3. I'm currently researhing VTXs and antenna types and placements.
