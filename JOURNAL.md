Started my project! Looked at inspiration on the highway gallery, my idea is to make a long-range Osprey-style tiltrotor drone that can transition between hovering and regular flight. Currently, I'm figuring out how the whole Hackclub thing works with the help of my cousin, Kashyap.

Sent a message in the slack to ask for advice on what frequency to use. I know I'm using RF, but some frequencies are banned in the U.S.
